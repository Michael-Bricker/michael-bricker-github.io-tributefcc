            <p> Mark Allen Mothersbaugh (born May 18, 1950) is an American singer, songwriter, composer,
                multi-instrumentalist, record producer, author and visual artist.
                <p>Mothersbaugh's music career spans more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as
                    co-founder, lead singer and keyboardist of the new wave band Devo, which released a Top 20 hit in
                    1980 with the single "Whip It". The band has maintained a cult following throughout its existence.
                    Mothersbaugh is one of the main composers of Devo's music and made major lyrical contributions to
                    the band's songs. He is one of only two members (along with bass player Gerald Casale) who have
                    been with Devo throughout its entire history.</p>

                <p>In addition to his work with Devo, Mothersbaugh has made music for television series, films and
                    video games via his production company, Mutato Muzika, most notably as the composer for the popular
                    long-running animated series Rugrats for its entire 13-year run, as well as all three theatrical
                    films. He has also had a solo career which has included four studio albums: Muzik for Insomniaks,
                    Muzik for the Gallery, Joyeux Mutato and The Most Powerful Healing Muzik in the Entire World. In
                    2004, he was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the BMI Film and TV Awards for his significant
                    contributions to film and television music. Additionally, Mothersbaugh was awarded an honorary
                    doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University in 2008.</p>
